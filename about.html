    <h1>Microphone Information</h1>
    <div class="texto">Microphones are intended to transform sound waves into electrical signals, which will be directed towards
        amplifiers, recorders or some other type of equipment. In other words, microphones are
        electroacoustic transducers, that is, they transform the energy from sound waves into electrical energy.
        Existing in various formats and types, this equipment is widely used in our daily lives for recording.
        of voice and musical instruments, to amplify a speaker's voice in front of a large audience and to capture
        voice on devices such as cell phones. Electromagnetic induction is the physical principle involved in the functioning
        of the microphone. Simply put, this concept states that the variation in magnetic flux through a loop
        will produce an electric current, called induced current.

        Sound is a type of mechanical wave, which propagates through the compression and rarefaction of molecules in the medium.
        Naturally, sound vibrations cannot stimulate electrical circuits, therefore, when they reach a
        microphone, the sound waves collide with membranes that are attached to coils, for example. The trapped coils
        The membranes are close to a magnet, so when they receive the sound waves, they will vibrate around the magnet in a
        that the magnetic flux is variable. The variation in magnetic flux generates an electric current that will follow the
        vibration patterns of sound waves.</p></div>
